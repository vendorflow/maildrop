= Copy of SendGrid SDK

The SendGrid Java SDK is incompatible with JPMS, and SendGrid [has closed
a request for support dating back three
years](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-java/issues/440). This is a
near-verbatim copy of the Java code of `sendgrid-java:4.7.4` and
`java-http-client:4.3.7` merged into a single JPMS module covering
`com.sendgrid`.

This copy is not shaded because Spring Boot includes out-of-the-box support
for configuring SendGrid connectivity, and that support is based on FQCNs
in the original namespace.

== Modifications

The only modifications performed were:

- rewriting the POM
- defining a `module-info.java`
- deleting the test class `TestRequiredFilesExist` (the files are important to
SendGrid's internal processes but were not retained)
- deleting the kitchen-sink test class `SendGridTest` (the tests are performed
using a real API key against a live SendGrid server)
